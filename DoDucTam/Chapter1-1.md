## Question 1: What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizer's testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

When it comes to **evel 2** testing, the goal is to find failures,but it could entail some negativities. testers may enjoy finding problems, otherwise, developers are never, therefore, it drives the testers and developers into an adversarial relationship which is bad for team morale. besides finding failures and faults, there are still several questions left such as: whether failures left or not? Is our work done? Is our software too good or the test is too weak? it is all about the confidence of the testers

**Level 3** begins when the realization that testing can show the presence, but not the absence,  of the failures. so it led us to the fact that we are always incur risks. they may be small and consequences are not worth to notice but some are great and consequences catastrophic, whatever they take, they are still there. so all developers and testers want the same thing is to reduce risk and minimize it as much as possible.

**Level 4** starts when the developers and testers are now on the same team. so it is described as a mental discipline that increases quality. There are several ways to increase the software quality and creating tests that cause the software to fail is only one. so test engineers can become the technical leaders of the project
