Chapter 1
1.	What are some factors that would help a development organization move from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4 (a mental discipline that increases quality)?

-	As we have already well known, the main goal for level two testing is to identify failures. Under that influence, it is no doubt that the level two testing could deteriorating the relationship between developers and tester engineers. Beyond that, back to the main goal, if there is no failure found, it left us with so much wondering. Are we doing a good on testing? Does our test strong enough to discover failures? Or Is Our software good, How much do we confident about the result.

-	The level 4 testing in turn to be focus on improving the product quality. It is defined as a metal discipline that INCREASES quality. Thus, test engineers can become technical leaders of the project, who will actively be responsible for the measuring and improving the software. Also, they will be co-operating with developer and help them to achieve the goal.

-	We are now be able to spot out the different between two levels and conclude the reason companies are moving to the level 4 testing. First, level 4 testing will put technical people in testing, which is an excellent thing to do since we have expertise on the line. Second, the distance between test engineers and developers will become shorter as they will work with each other to improve their product quality. Finally, there will be a management in leadership as tester now can become a tech-lead in the project.
