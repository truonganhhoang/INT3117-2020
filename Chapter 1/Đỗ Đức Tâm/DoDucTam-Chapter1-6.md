Quest 6: 
a
i had experience to work in VNPT as a full stack-developer trainee, in that time, i have only do testing from level 0 to 3 :

level 0: testing = debugging,
level 1: testing shows correctness, 
level 2: testing shows the program does not work,
level 3: testing reduces risk

at  level 0, i try to make my code run,
at level 1, i correct the logic and make it fit with criteria of requirement,
and at level 2 and 3, i validate it with special test cases,

 There is another team to test the software only to be specialized and if they are found, they will give me feedback and I will correct them over and over again.
