# 1. What are some factors that would help a development organization move
from Beizer’s testing level 2 (testing is to show errors) to testing level 4
(a mental discipline that increases quality)?

- In Level 2 tetsing, the purpose is to show failures. But Level 3 tesing show 
the presence, not absence or failure.
 If we use software, we expose some risks. The risk may be smal and unimportant
, or the risk may be great and the consequences are catastrophic, but the risk
is always there.
- In level 3 testing, both testers and developers work together to reduce risk.
Once the testers and developers are on the same "team", an organization can progress to
real Level 4 testing.


# 2. What is the difference between software fault and software failure?

- Software failure occurs when the software does not do what the user expects to see.
- Software fault, on the other hand, is a hidden programming error.
- A software fault becomes a software failure only when the exact computation conditions are met, and the faulty portion of the code is executed on the CPU.

# 3. What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

- Testing can show the presence of failures but not their absence.
- Using the software, we are always at risk. The risk could be insignificant or could be significant.
- We can't reduce the risk to zero.

# 6.Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background.
(b) If you have never worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think that you have? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness,
2: testing shows the program doesn’t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4: testing is a mental
discipline about quality).

- I think i have level 0(testing = debugging) of test maturity since i do not have any experience 
in software testing.
