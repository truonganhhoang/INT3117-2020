# Question 3: What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

+ A software always has risk when it running. We can never know all of the risk, so we cannot fix it all, we just can reduce it as much as possible.
+ The risk can classified in many levels of importancy, depends on each project. It might very small and rarely to occur, or very big that can crash the software. The more complex the software is, the more risk it has and many of them is so small that we can never find and fix it in one go. 
+ In theory, we can reduce the risk to zero, but in real life, it is nearly impossible to a normal human being can detect all the risk to fix it.
